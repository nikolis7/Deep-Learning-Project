# Deep-Learning-Project
Medical Image Classification 

Hello we are [Nikolas](https://github.com/nikolis7) and [Marios](https://github.com/votaldo)
This is a project developed within the course `Deep Learning` for our **Master's Degree in Data Science**. 

The main resources we will use to develop our Medical Image Classification project are:
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index]) (to deplot code and report our progress)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/learn-ml?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqPGUBhDwARIsANNwjV7LnBk3geGnJ7dztoqsaVvw53xXhYAFtLdW47irptwfgUJZrakvo0EaAvxfEALw_wcB) (for our Neural Networks)
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)(for our Neural Networks)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (for our datasets)
