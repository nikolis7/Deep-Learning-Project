# Deep-Learning-Project
Medical Image Classification (X-rays and MRI's)

Hello we are [Nikolas](https://github.com/nikolis7) and [Marios](https://github.com/votaldo)
This is a project developed within the course `Deep Learning` for our **[MSc Program in Data Science](http://msc-data-science.iit.demokritos.gr)**. 

The main resources we will use to develop our Medical Image Classification project are:
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index]) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (to deplot code and report our progress)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/learn-ml?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqPGUBhDwARIsANNwjV7LnBk3geGnJ7dztoqsaVvw53xXhYAFtLdW47irptwfgUJZrakvo0EaAvxfEALw_wcB) (for our Neural Networks)
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)(for our Neural Networks)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (for our datasets)

Our main goals for this project are:
* Successfully preprocess the images
  * Rescale the images
  * Normalise 
  * Perform data augmentation 
* Build CCNs
* Perform transfer learning
